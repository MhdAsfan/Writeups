# Writeups

Welcome to my **Writeups** repo! This is a collection of beginner-friendly notes and guides on cybersecurity topics. I created it to share simple breakdowns of concepts like OWASP risks and CISSP domains. Perfect for new analysts, devs, or anyone learning security.

## What's Here? 📝
- **OWASP Top 10 2025**: Easy fixes for app vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, crypto fails).
- **CISSP Security Domains**: 8 key areas explained simply – from risk plans to safe coding.
- More to come: CTF solutions, research notes, and quick tips.

Check the [docs](docs/) folder for Markdown files.

## How to Use 🚀
- **Read**: Open files in GitHub or clone the repo.
- **Search**: Look for tags like #OWASP or #CISSP.
- **Learn**: Each guide has what/why/how + tips.
