## 🔧 Core Components

### 🧩 1. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
**SIEM tools** collect and analyze log data from systems, networks, and applications.  
They help detect suspicious patterns and generate alerts in real-time.

- **Purpose:** Identify and monitor potential security threats.
- **Examples:** Splunk, IBM QRadar, Microsoft Sentinel
- **Key Benefit:** Centralized visibility and faster response to incidents.

---

### 🌐 2. Network Protocol Analyzers (Packet Sniffers)
**Network analyzers** capture and examine network traffic packets to identify unauthorized access or data leaks.

- **Purpose:** Analyze data flow across the network and detect anomalies.
- **Example Tool:** Wireshark
- **Key Benefit:** Helps trace suspicious activity at the packet level.

### 📘 3. Playbooks
**Playbooks** provide structured, step-by-step procedures for responding to incidents and preserving evidence.

Two important types include:

1. **Chain of Custody Playbook:**  
   Ensures all evidence is properly tracked — who handled it, where it’s stored, and when it moved.

2. **Protecting & Preserving Evidence Playbook:**  
   Guides analysts in safely handling volatile digital data without altering or destroying it.

- **Purpose:** Maintain legal and procedural integrity during investigations.
- **Key Benefit:** Ensures consistent, reliable, and defensible incident response.

## ⚙️ Why These Tools Matter
These tools empower security teams to:
- Maintain **visibility** across systems and networks.
- Preserve **accuracy** in forensic investigations.
- Improve **speed** in identifying and responding to threats.
