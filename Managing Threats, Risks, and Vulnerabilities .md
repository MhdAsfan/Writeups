# Managing Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities 🚨

Cybersecurity is about protecting organizations and people from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

---

## 1. What Is Risk Management?

Organizations protect important things called **assets**.

**Assets can be:**
- Digital (employee data, client info, account numbers)
- Physical (kiosks, servers, desktops, offices)

**Main risk strategies:**
- Acceptance: Take the risk if it’s small or can’t be avoided
- Avoidance: Change plans to stop the risk
- Transference: Let someone else handle the risk (insurance)
- Mitigation: Reduce the harm if risk happens

**Helpful frameworks:**

## 2. Basic Concepts

| Term           | Meaning                                   | Example                |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Threat         | Something bad that could happen           | Hacker, malware        |
| Risk           | Chance a threat causes harm               | Old software risk      |
| Vulnerability  | Weakness that could be attacked           | No security updates    |

## 3. Common Threats

- Insider threats (misusing internal access)
- Advanced Persistent Threats (hidden attackers)

---

## 4. Types of Risks

- External (outsiders, hackers)
- Internal (employees, vendors)
- Legacy (old computers, software)
- Multiparty (third-party risks)
- Software compliance (not following rules)

## 5. Common Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability      | Description                         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| ProxyLogon         | Exchange server remote attack       |
| ZeroLogon          | Netlogon authentication attack      |
| Log4Shell          | Java code or data leak              |
| PetitPotam         | Windows NTLM network attack         |
| Logging failures   | Attacks not found quickly           |
| SSRF               | Server tricked into unsafe action   |

**Tip:** Always monitor and patch your systems!
